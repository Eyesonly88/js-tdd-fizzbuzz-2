JavaScript Test Driven Development Session 2
=================

We will continue working on the fizzbuzz kata. 

In this session we will learn:

- How to create a test double in JavaScript to help us unit test our code that has dependencies.
- How to run our tests from the command line using PhantomJS and Grover


Pre-requisites:

1- Node.js (http://nodejs.org/) is installed on your computer. (very easy to install)
2- Install Grover: npm -g install grover
